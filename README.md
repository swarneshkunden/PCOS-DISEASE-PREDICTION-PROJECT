## Running the Project

Run the following command inside the project folder: 
python main.py

PCOS-DISEASE-PREDICTION-PROJECT/
│── models/              # Trained models (.h5 files)
│── main.py              # Main script (entry point)
│── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
│── README.md            # Documentation


Save the file. ✅
