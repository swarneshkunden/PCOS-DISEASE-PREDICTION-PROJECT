# PCOS Disease Prediction Project

## üìñ About the Project
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders affecting women.  
This project uses **Deep Learning models (DCNN + BiLSTM with Attention)** to predict the presence of PCOS based on medical and clinical data.  

The project includes:
- Preprocessing of patient medical data  
- Training and evaluation of deep learning models  
- Pre-trained `.h5` models for quick predictions  
- Scripts to run predictions directly without retraining

- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for deep learning)  
- **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn** (for data handling & preprocessing)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experimentation)
